          <h3>Why the JAX AI Stack?</h3>
          <p>
            The JAX AI Stack helps navigate the many available libraries built on top of JAX by providing a curated set of libraries known to work well together and a cohesive experience with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The JAX AI Stack also provides:
            <ul>
              <li>Simplified installation for all libraries</li>
              <li>Tested releases that ensure all library versions are compatible with each other</li>
              <li>Guides and tutorials for using the stack</li>

            <h3>Powered by JAX</h3>
            <p>JAX is a Python library for efficient array-oriented computation and program transformation. JAX's flexible and modular approach has encouraged communities across AI, scientific computing, simulation and more to build ecosystems on top of it.</p>
            <p>JAX is often compared to neural network libraries like PyTorch, but the core JAX package contains very little specific to deep learning. Instead, JAX encourages modularity, where domain-specific libraries are developed separately from the core package. This helps drive innovation as researchers and other users explore what's possible.</p>
