# Flax NNX: neural nets

Flax NNX provides **neural net functionality** on top of JAX, such as a module
abstraction and pre-defined layers, via a **Pythonic object-oriented API**. NNX
allows you to write stateful model code that can still take advantage of JAX's
function transforms and other features.

NNX has native integration with [Optax](stack_optax).
