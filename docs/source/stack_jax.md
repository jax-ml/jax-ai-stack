# JAX: array computing

JAX is the foundation of the JAX AI Stack! It provides **high-performance array
computing** functionality over accelerators via a simple **NumPy-like API and
function transformations**.

Main JAX site: **[jax.dev{material-regular}`open_in_new`](https://jax.dev)**

**If you'd like to learn more about JAX** beyond what's covered in the
[](getting_started) guide, we recommend starting with the **[JAX
tutorials{material-regular}`open_in_new`](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/tutorials.html)**.
