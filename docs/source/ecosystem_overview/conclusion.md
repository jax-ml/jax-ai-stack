# Conclusion: A Durable, Production-Ready Platform for the Future of AI

The data provided in the table above draws to a rather simple conclusion \- these stacks have their own strengths and weaknesses in a small number of areas but overall are vastly similar from the software standpoint. Both stacks provide out of the box turnkey solutions for pre-training, post-training adaptation and deployment of foundational models.

The JAX AI stack offers a compelling and robust solution for training and deploying ML models at any scale. It leverages deep vertical integration across software and TPU hardware to deliver class-leading performance and total cost of ownership.

By building on battle-tested internal systems, the stack has evolved to provide inherent reliability and scalability, enabling users to confidently develop and deploy even the largest models. Its modular and composable design, rooted in the JAX ecosystem philosophy, grants users unparalleled freedom and control, allowing them to tailor the stack to their specific needs without the constraints of a monolithic framework.

With XLA and Pathways providing a scalable and fault-tolerant base, JAX providing a performant and expressive numerics library, powerful core development libraries like [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), Optax, [Grain](https://google-grain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [Orbax](#orbax:tensorstore), advanced performance tools like Pallas, Tokamax, and Qwix, and a robust application and production layer in [MaxText](#foundational-model-maxtext-and), vLLM-TPU, and NSE, the JAX AI stack provides a durable foundation for users to build on and rapidly bring state-of-the-art research to production.
