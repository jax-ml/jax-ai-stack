    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to implement LoRA for efficient fine-tuning of language models in JAX.\n",
    "It builds upon the [JAX for LLM pretraining](https://docs.jaxstack.ai/en/latest/JAX_for_LLM_pretraining.html) tutorial by showing how to replace standard linear\n",
    "layers with LoRA-enabled linear layers to significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that:\n",
    "- Keeps pre-trained model weights frozen\n",
    "- Adds small trainable low-rank decomposition matrices to certain layers\n",
    "- Drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters (often by 90%+)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first chapter we will buildi a LoRA-enabled model from scratch, while the next chapter: \"2. Fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM with LoRA\" will demonstrate the more common and practical workflow of applying LoRA to existing pre-trained models.\n",

    "In this chapter, we'll take an unconventional approach by implementing a language model with LoRA from scratch. This is different from standard practice, where LoRA is typically applied to already pre-trained models as a fine-tuning technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we doing it this way? While not the optimal approach to train a model that achives good preformace (as we'll see in our results), building from scratch makes the integration of LoRA components within the model architecture more clear.\n",
